# Machine Problem 1

Write a program using MSVC++ that draws a square on the screen.  

The square should be hard-coded into the program using World Coordinates.

The program should translate the square from World Coordinates into Screen Coordinates.  

Feel free to place the square anywhere in the world of any size. However, the program **must** compute the "world to screen" coordinates using the method described in course lecture videos (the 2 step process) and use the results of that calculation to draw the square on the screen.

IMPORTANT!  When handing in your program, please zip the source code files only.

- DO NOT HAND IN EXE OR OBJ FILES!  
- Do not hand in 'temporary' MSVC project files.  
- I must be able to compile and link your project on my computer.  
- If I cannot compile and link your program, you will receive a zero for a grade.  
- If I get a virus because you send me an EXE or infected file, you will receive a zero for a grade.  
- Please follow instructions exactly.

ZIP up your source code files and name your zip file as:  LastnameFirstname_MP1.zip and upload here to blackboard on time.  
You must upload your zip to Blackboard before I can enter a grade.
