## Problem Description

Write a program using MSVC++ that draws a square on the screen.  

The square should be hard-coded into the program using World Coordinates.

The program should translate the square from World Coordinates into Screen Coordinates.  

Feel free to place the square anywhere in the world of any size. However, the program **must** compute the "world to screen" coordinates using the method described in course lecture videos (the 2 step process) and use the results of that calculation to draw the square on the screen.

IMPORTANT!  When handing in your program, please zip the source code files only.
